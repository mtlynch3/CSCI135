Write the following terminal instructions:
	a) Compile a program called myprog.cpp into an executable file with the default name
		g++ myprog.cpp
	b) Run this executable
		./a.out
	d) Compile the same program myprog.cpp into an executable file called myprog
		g++ myprog.cpp -o myprog
	e) Run the executable myprog
		./myprog
	f) Run the exectuable myprog with input redirection from the text file data.txt
		./myprog < data.txt

What are the valid indices of this array: int counts[6]?
	0,1,2,3,4,5

Suppose you have the following string:
	string fruit = "banana";
How can you use the substr method to print out "nan"?
	cout << fruit.substr(2,3) << endl;

Assume you have a variable defined as follows:
  double x = 19.889324;
Using the manipulators defined in <iomanip>, print out x so that there are only 3 significant digits and 4 whitespaces in front of it.
  cout << setprecision(3) << setw(8) << x << endl;
